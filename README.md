# TicTacToe-Game

A web tic-tac-toe game written using React, created as part of my React studies/course, with some simple modifications!

The React web-app was developed with CodeSandbox. To run in CodeSandbox:
1. o=Open in CodeSandbox
2. Click the CodeSandbox tab in the side menu
3. Click on Tasks, on "start" click on the Play button. 
4. Click on Previews, on "3000" click the Play button. This should display the preview of the web-app.
